# PosterView developer guide

PosterView combines native media libraries and artwork management for connected
Plex, Emby and Jellyfin servers. Rust/Axum and SQLite provide the server;
React/Vite/TypeScript/Tailwind provide the frontend. One Docker image serves both.
Read `AGENTS.md` and relevant scoped instructions before changing ownership.

## Commands

```sh
# Repository root
cargo run --package posterview-server
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings

# frontend/
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
```

The server defaults to 7979; Vite uses 5173 and proxies `/api` to the server. The
workspace minimum Rust version and Docker/CI toolchain are 1.88. Newer Clippy
versions may diagnose existing code differently; record the toolchain used.
FFmpeg/ffprobe enable media fixtures. Live provider verification needs explicitly
supplied credentials and is opt-in. Install dependencies with `npm ci` and use the
committed Cargo/npm lockfiles. Build/deployment configuration is unchanged.

Use focused checks while editing, then the full commands above. On Windows,
serialize Cargo tests/builds sharing `target/`: running executables cannot be
relinked. If monitor tests time out during parallel media processing, compare
`cargo test --workspace --locked -- --test-threads=1` and report both outcomes.
Do not hide baseline failures or waive regressions.

## Rust module map

| Boundary | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `posterview-contracts` | Shared normalized API and native library/catalog models |
| `posterview-infra-media-servers` | Plex/Emby/Jellyfin normalization and remote operations |
| `posterview-infra-artwork` | Artwork provider clients, authentication/search/downloads |
| `posterview-infra-sqlite` | Main database, encrypted secrets, native catalog and migrations |
| `posterview-url-security` | Media-server/provider URL trust policy |
| `posterview-runtime` | Host-independent orchestration, artwork operations and cache |
| `apps/server/src/lib.rs` | Public facade, SPA/middleware composition, worker startup |
| `apps/server/src/state.rs` | Shared state constructor and backdrop refresh helper |
| `apps/server/src/routes/` | System/auth, connected-server and artwork HTTP adapters; legacy registry |
| `apps/server/src/playback/` | Native playback and feature route registration |

`playback/models.rs` holds wire models; `planner.rs` makes capability/quality
choices; `hardware.rs` probes/selects encoders; `manifest.rs` owns HLS retention.
`mod.rs` remains the delivery/session/resource facade. Planner/manifest tests are
adjacent; `tests.rs` covers cross-boundary streaming and process behavior.

Native CRUD/scan coordination remains in `native.rs`. Discovery/probing,
monitoring, missing items, identification, providers and artwork already have
separate `native_*.rs` modules. `google_books.rs`, `reader.rs`, `metadata.rs`,
`watch.rs`, `transcoding.rs` and `scheduled_tasks.rs` keep their feature interfaces.
Shared fixtures now come from `test_support.rs`, not native scan tests. Feature
routers return `Router<AppState>`; central composition applies authentication
once. Preserve explicit public and compatibility registrations.

Existing crates already supply the necessary dependency boundaries. No new crate
was added. Further extraction should identify a reusable interface or concrete
ownership/dependency problem first.

## Frontend module map

```text

  App.tsx, main.tsx          routing and bootstrap

      types.ts              canonical playback/watch contracts and defaults
      api/                  delivery and watch/preferences/rules clients
      components/           Play/Resume, Continue Watching, preferences/rules
      lib/                  capability and track-selection helpers
    settings/
      appearance/           appearance/theme controls
      providers/            credentials and default artwork provider forms
      formStyles.ts         shared settings input styling
  pages/                    remaining route composition and pages
  components/, lib/         reused UI/utilities and remaining catalog/reader/auth
```

Playback tests moved with their code. Wire definitions and watch endpoints have
one implementation each. Both feature API clients use `apiRequest`; the player
uses the watch client for watch operations. Media/WASM dependencies stay lazy-loaded.
API modules re-export their types for existing consumers; definitions live in
`features/playback/types.ts`.

`SettingsPage.tsx` selects sections and provides their frame. Appearance and
provider editors are independent leaves. `PluginsPage.tsx` imports default
provider forms directly, removing its cycle with SettingsPage. Appearance preview
loads the settings page lazily instead of statically importing its composition.
Existing page tests still verify the composed flow.

Artwork (`ArtworkPanel`, `ArtworkBrowser`, `PosterDBPanel`, provider panels),
reading (`ReaderPage`, `ReaderPages`, `lib/reader*`), catalog/detail views
(`NativeLibraryBrowser`, native catalog helpers), and authentication (`AuthGate`,
`AuthProvider`, idle-session helpers) remain in established locations. Shared UI,
transport, navigation, theme and artwork-target utilities remain shared. Move
these only when a task needs a useful responsibility boundary.

## Dividing cross-layer work

Assign exact files and interfaces before concurrent edits. The main agent owns
shared contracts, dependencies, schemas/migrations, configuration, composition
and documentation. Feature agents own implementations and behavior tests.
Read-only review is useful alongside implementation; subagents are unnecessary
for every small edit.

Example: a playback quality option.

1. Main agrees request/response/default behavior and reserves Rust
   `playback/models.rs`, frontend `features/playback/types.ts`, configuration and
   integration edits.
2. Backend agent owns `playback/planner.rs` and its tests. Reserve `hardware.rs`
   separately only when a different encoder needs investigation.
3. Frontend agent owns `features/playback/PlayerPage.tsx` and interaction tests
   against that agreed contract; it requests client/contract changes instead of
   racing the integration owner.
4. Main integrates sequentially, verifies both layers, reviews the diff and
   handles authorized shipping.

Example: a book metadata provider.

1. Backend agent owns the new provider adapter and local fixtures.
2. Frontend agent owns its dedicated configuration/search components and tests.
3. Main owns provider enums/settings, encrypted persistence, HTTP registration,
   native-library wiring, dependencies and deployment configuration. These edits
   are sequenced after agreeing the provider contract.

Do not assign the same file to two writers, even for different functions. Renames
and import rewrites require coordination with consumers. Remaining large native,
reader, catalog and watch files have one writer per task; further splits should
follow responsibilities rather than a size quota.

## Compatibility and storage

The refactor preserves URL patterns, JSON fields/defaults, catalog identity,
query/localStorage keys, worker behavior and deployment files. Native paths and
connected-server URLs retain their existing trust rules.

`posterview.db` holds application/server settings, encrypted credentials and the
native catalog. `reader.sqlite` and `watch.sqlite` remain separate stores under
application data. Authentication/security configuration and the Fernet key stay
in their established locations. SQL changes anywhere require migration ownership;
moving a module does not authorize changing its schema or data location.

Protected routes require administrator authentication by default. Configuration
still controls disabled authentication, TCP-peer LAN bypass, idle timeout and
secure cookies. Public health/auth/backdrop and existing compatibility plugin
registrations are unchanged. Forwarded headers do not define trusted peers.
Playing heartbeats refresh authenticated activity; ordinary polling/image loads
do not. Credential handling and URL validation remain server-side.

Artwork applies retain runtime/provider behavior. Legacy artwork history has
been retired; older Python-era instructions requiring history recording on every
apply no longer apply. See [native playback setup](docs/native-playback.md) for
playback behavior and GPU configuration.

## Practical checks

- Preserve untouched NFO fields and media sidecars during native metadata edits.
- Jellyfin/Emby uploads use base64 payloads; backdrops have list semantics. Plex
  and providers have different upload rules; use the existing adapters.
- Rate limits and unavailable servers are not cache/authentication failures; test
  connections before changing shared behavior.
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` prepares data bind-mount ownership and excludes media.
  PUID/PGID/UMASK and GPU device access remain host configuration.
- Manually installed Unraid templates belong in `templates-user/`.

Finish with focused commits and verification, baseline failures, remaining
coordination points and authorized push/build status. Preserve local artifacts
and unrelated changes; repository guidance alone is not shipping permission.
